                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">1. Overview</h2>
                                    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("the Terms and Conditions") govern your ("the User") use of the dochase.com ("Provider") website located at the domain name www.dochase.com ("the Website"). By accessing and using the Website, the User agrees to be bound by the Terms and Conditions set out in this legal notice.</p>
                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">2. Unconditional Rights</h2>
                                    <p>The Provider supplies services to advertisers and third party website operators. Advertisements from advertisers are contextually matched to the best content available on our third party website operators. The parties involved in this process are Advertisers (users that pay for advertising) and Publishers (users that operate websites and place our ads on their content). Access to the Website is provided at the discretion of the Provider and access may be revoked at any time for no reason.</p>
                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">3. Advertisers</h2>
                                    <p>The nature of the advertising is Pay Per Click and the advertiser will pay a fee per click each time their ads are clicked. The cost of this click is determined by the Provider's algorithms, which will remain confidential at all times. The cost of the click will never exceed the advertisers maximum cost per click, which is pre-set by the User on the Website and may be adjusted from time to time by the User.</p>
                                    <p>The overall expenditure of the advertiser will never exceed the daily budget. Costs are billed based on risk and ad delivery algorithms and the advertiser, by loading their credit card details onto the Website, authorizes the Provider to collect costs on a weekly basis according to the expenditure that has taken place.</p>
                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">4. Publishers/Source</h2>
                                    <p>Publishers/SSP are users participating with the Website to deliver advertisements. Publishers will receive agreed share (usually majority share) of all revenue paid by advertisers. Payment to Publishers will be made on a monthly basis by the Provider, as long as earnings by the Publisher reach N3000; payments are processed to the publisher on confirmation that the publisher is not guilty of fraud clicks, within 7 (seventheen) days after each month.</p>
                                    <p>Publishers may not click on an advertisement on their own Website to increase earnings. Dochase.com reserves the right to deduct any transactions detected as fraudulent. Dochase may serve advertisements sourced from 3rd parties, such as ad networks.</p>
                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">5. Click Fraud</h2>
                                    <p>If Provider determines that click fraud has taken place - usually when a publisher wishes to increase their earnings unfairly or an advertiser wishes to deplete a competitive advertiser's daily budget - then the Provider reserves the right to reverse any revenues or charges related to the fraud, and to suspend the account of the infringing party with immediate effect.</p>
                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">6. Pre-Vetting</h2>
                                    <p>Some publishers/SSP may be provided with the functionality to pre-qualify advertisers in order to ensure that they are acceptable and do not conflict with the publishers advertising policies. These publishers will not use the pre-vetting functionality for lead generation - in other words, the Provider is listing its advertisers in good faith and these advertisers may not be approached directly by the publisher.</p>
                                    <hr class="my-5" />
                                    <h2 class="mb-3">7. Copyright</h2>

                                    <h2 class="mb-3">13. Non Profit Organization Advertising</h2>
                                    <p>In certain situations the Provider may be unable to match relevant advertising to the Content on the Website.
