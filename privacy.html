                                    <h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
                                    <p>We do not collect any personal data or information that identies users personally. We do not do cookies sync with any thirdparty technology or provider. We comply with all privacy laws of the EU, US and others countries.</p>
                                    <p>The Information we collect: We only collect data that is necessary for ad targeting in compliance with international laws on privacy.</p>

                                    <h2 class="mb-3">Location information</h2>
                                    <p>Information regarding your location may be recorded and used when visiting a site that hosts one of our ads. We do this in order to make sure that the ads you are viewing are within a close range to your location.</p>
                                    <p>For EEA Internet Users, the meaning of "Personal Data" under the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and what this means for Platform Data.</p>
                                    <p>"Personal Data" is defined as any data relating to a living individual who can be identified directly from that data, or indirectly in conjunction with other information. It can take the form of a name or address, and can extend to unique identifiers, IP addresses and other identifiers which do not tell us who an Internet user is in the "real world" but may, when combined with other information, allow the identification of a living individual.</p>
                                    <p>We do not collect personal data that identifies you as an individual in the "real world." When you (an Internet user) visit a Digital Property that has integrated our technology or that uses technology that integrates with our Platform, we do not know your name or email address or other information that directly identifies you. We take care to ensure that we do not collect any information that tells us who you are.</p>
                                    <p>Instead, when you first visit a Digital Property that has integrated our technology, this triggers a request to our Platform to fill ad space or measure information about an ad shown to you. When this occurs, we assign a random unique identifier (a Digital Identifier) an "Dochase ID," to your browser or device, which allows the Platform to automatically recognize your browser or device the next time it visits another Digital Property that has integrated our technology. This type of "pseudonymous data" is defined as "Personal Data" under the GDPR.</p>
                                    <p>This allows our clients to sync their own Digital Identifiers against this Dochase ID (see ID Synching below) so that our clients can use their own data on the Platform.</p>
